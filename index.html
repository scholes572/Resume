                        As a dedicated student developer, I have invested significant time in self-directed learning and practical application of software development principles. Through building multiple full-stack applications from scratch, I have developed strong problem-solving abilities, project management skills, and the capacity to work independently while meeting deadlines. My portfolio demonstrates not only technical competence but also initiative, creativity, and a genuine passion for technology and innovation.
